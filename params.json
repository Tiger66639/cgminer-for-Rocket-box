devices and BFx2 USB ASICs.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSETTING UP USB DEVICES\r\n\r\nWINDOWS:\r\n\r\nOn windows, the direct USB support requires the installation of a WinUSB\r\ndriver (NOT the ftdi_sio driver), and attach it to the chosen USB device.\r\nWhen configuring your device, plug it in and wait for windows to attempt to\r\ninstall a driver on its own. It may think it has succeeded or failed but wait\r\nfor it to finish regardless. This is NOT the driver you want installed. At this\r\npoint you need to associate your device with the WinUSB driver. The easiest\r\nway to do this is to use the zadig utility which you must right click on and\r\nrun as administrator. Then once you plug in your device you can choose the\r\n\"list all devices\" from the \"option\" menu and you should be able to see the\r\ndevice as something like: \"BitFORCE SHA256 SC\". Choose the install or replace\r\ndriver option and select WinUSB. You can either google for zadig or download\r\nit from the cgminer directory in the DOWNLOADS link above.\r\n\r\nWhen you first switch a device over to WinUSB with zadig and it shows that\r\ncorrectly on the left of the zadig window, but it still gives permission\r\nerrors, you may need to unplug the USB miner and then plug it back in. Some\r\nusers may need to reboot at this point.\r\n\r\n\r\nLINUX:\r\n\r\nOn linux, the direct USB support requires no drivers at all. However due to\r\npermissions issues, you may not be able to mine directly on the devices as a\r\nregular user without giving the user access to the device or by mining as\r\nroot (administrator). In order to give your regular user access, you can make\r\nhim a member of the plugdev group with the following commands:\r\n\r\n sudo usermod -G plugdev -a `whoami`\r\n\r\nIf your distribution does not have the plugdev group you can create it with:\r\n\r\n sudo groupadd plugdev\r\n\r\nIn order for the USB devices to instantly be owned by the plugdev group and\r\naccessible by anyone from the plugdev group you can copy the file\r\n\"01-cgminer.rules\" from the cgminer archive into the /etc/udev/rules.d\r\ndirectory with the following command:\r\n\r\n sudo cp 01-cgminer.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/\r\n\r\nAfter this you can either manually restart udev and re-login, or more easily\r\njust reboot.\r\n\r\n\r\nOSX:\r\n\r\nOn OSX, like Linux, no drivers need to be installed. However some devices\r\nlike the bitfury USB sticks automatically load a driver thinking they're a\r\nmodem and the driver needs to be unloaded for cgminer to work:\r\n\r\n sudo kextunload -b com.apple.driver.AppleUSBCDC\r\n sudo kextunload -b com.apple.driver.AppleUSBCDCACMData\r\n\r\nThere may be a limit to the number of USB devices that you are allowed to start.\r\nThe following set of commands, followed by a reboot will increase that:\r\n\r\n sudo su\r\n touch /etc/sysctl.conf\r\n echo kern.sysv.semume=100 >> /etc/sysctl.conf\r\n chown root:wheel /etc/sysctl.conf\r\n chmod 0644 /etc/sysctl.conf\r\n\r\nSome devices need superuser access to mine on them so cgminer may need to\r\nbe started with sudo\r\ni.e.:\r\n sudo cgminer <insert commands here>\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAdvanced USB options:\r\n\r\nThe --usb option can restrict how many USB devices are found:\r\n\r\n  --usb 1:2,1:3,1:4,1:*\r\nor\r\n  --usb BAS:1,BFL:1,MMQ:0,ICA:0,KLN:0\r\nor\r\n  --usb :10\r\n\r\nYou can only use one of the above 3\r\n\r\nThe first version\r\n  --usb 1:2,1:3,1:4,1:*\r\nallows you to select which devices to mine on with a list of USB\r\n bus_number:device_address\r\nAll other USB devices will be ignored\r\nHotplug will also only look at the devices matching the list specified and\r\nfind nothing new if they are all in use\r\nYou can specify just the USB bus_number to find all devices like 1:*\r\nwhich means any devices on USB bus_number 1\r\nThis is useful if you unplug a device then plug it back in the same port,\r\nit usually reappears with the same bus_number but a different device_address\r\n\r\nYou can see the list of all USB devices on linux with 'sudo lsusb'\r\nCgminer will list the recognised USB devices\r\n\r\nwith the '-n' option or the\r\n'--usb-dump 0' option\r\nThe '--usb-dump N' option with a value of N greater than 0 will dump a lot\r\nof details about each recognised USB device\r\nIf you wish to see all USB devices, include the --usb-list-all option\r\n\r\nThe second version\r\n  --usb BAS:1,BFL:1,MMQ:0,ICA:0,KLN:0\r\nallows you to specify how many devices to choose based on each device\r\ndriver cgminer has - the current USB drivers are:\r\nAVA, BAS, BFL, BF1, DRB, HFA, ICA, KLN and MMQ.\r\n\r\nN.B. you can only specify which device driver to limit, not the type of\r\neach device, e.g. with BAS:n you can limit how many BFL ASIC devices will\r\nbe checked, but you cannot limit the number of each type of BFL ASIC\r\n\r\nAlso note that the MMQ count is the number of MMQ backplanes you have\r\nnot the number of MMQ FPGAs\r\n\r\nThe third version\r\n  --usb :10\r\nmeans only use a maximum of 10 devices of any supported USB devices\r\nOnce cgminer has 10 devices it will not configure any more and hotplug will\r\nnot scan for any more\r\nIf one of the 10 devices stops working, hotplug - if enabled, as is default\r\n- will scan normally again until it has 10 devices\r\n\r\n  --usb :0 will disable all USB I/O other than to initialise libusb\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWHILE RUNNING:\r\n\r\nThe following options are available while running with a single keypress:\r\n\r\n [U]SB management [P]ool management [S]ettings [D]isplay options [Q]uit\r\n\r\n\r\nU gives you:\r\n\r\n[S]ummary of device information\r\n[E]nable device\r\n[D]isable device\r\n[U]nplug to allow hotplug restart\r\n[R]eset device USB\r\n[L]ist all known devices\r\n[B]lacklist current device from current instance of cgminer\r\n[W]hitelist previously blacklisted device\r\n[H]otplug interval (0 to disable)\r\n\r\n\r\nP gives you:\r\n\r\nCurrent pool management strategy: Failover\r\n[F]ailover only disabled\r\n[A]dd pool [R]emove pool [D]isable pool [E]nable pool\r\n[C]hange management strategy [S]witch pool [I]nformation\r\n\r\n\r\nS gives you:\r\n\r\n[Q]ueue: 1\r\n[S]cantime: 60\r\n[E]xpiry: 120\r\n[W]rite config file\r\n[C]gminer restart\r\n\r\n\r\nD gives you:\r\n\r\n[N]ormal [C]lear [S]ilent mode (disable all output)\r\n[D]ebug:off\r\n[P]er-device:off\r\n[Q]uiet:off\r\n[V]erbose:off\r\n[R]PC debug:off\r\n[W]orkTime details:off\r\nco[M]pact: off\r\n[T]oggle status switching:enabled\r\n[Z]ero statistics\r\n[L]og interval:5\r\n\r\n\r\nQ quits the application.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe running log shows output like this:\r\n\r\n [2013-11-09 11:04:41] Accepted 01b3bde7 Diff 150/128 AVA 1 pool 0\r\n [2013-11-09 11:04:49] Accepted 015df995 Diff 187/128 AVA 1 pool 0\r\n [2013-11-09 11:04:50] Accepted 01163b68 Diff 236/128 AVA 1 pool 0\r\n [2013-11-09 11:04:53] Accepted 9f745840 Diff 411/128 BAS 1 pool 0\r\n\r\nThe 8 byte hex value are the 1st nonzero bytes of the share being submitted to\r\nthe pool.

Each has their advantages and disadvantages so multiple strategies\r\nare available by user choice, as per the following list:\r\n\r\nFAILOVER:\r\nThe default strategy is failover. This means that if you input a number of\r\npools, it will try to use them as a priority list, moving away from the 1st\r\nto the 2nd, 2nd to 3rd and so on. If any of the earlier pools recover, it will\r\nmove back to the higher priority ones.\r\n\r\nROUND ROBIN:\r\nThis strategy only moves from one pool to the next when the current one falls\r\nidle and makes no attempt to move otherwise.\r\n\r\nROTATE:\r\nThis strategy moves at user-defined intervals from one active pool to the next,\r\nskipping pools that are idle.\r\n\r\nLOAD BALANCE:\r\nThis strategy sends work to all the pools on a quota basis. By default, all\r\npools are allocated equal quotas unless specified with --quota. This\r\napportioning of work is based on work handed out, not shares returned so is\r\nindependent of difficulty targets or rejected shares. While a pool is disabled\r\nor dead, its quota is dropped until it is re-enabled. Quotas are forward\r\nlooking, so if the quota is changed on the fly, it only affects future work.\r\nIf all pools are set to zero quota or all pools with quota are dead, it will\r\nfall back to a failover mode. See quota below for more information.\r\n\r\nThe failover-only flag has special meaning in combination with load-balance\r\nmode and it will distribute quota back to priority pool 0 from any pools that\r\nare unable to provide work for any reason so as to maintain quota ratios\r\nbetween the rest of the pools.\r\n\r\nBALANCE:\r\nThis strategy monitors the amount of difficulty 1 shares solved for each pool\r\nand uses it to try to end up doing the same amount of work for all pools.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nQUOTAS\r\n\r\nThe load-balance multipool strategy works off a quota based scheduler. The\r\nquotas handed out by default are equal, but the user is allowed to specify any\r\narbitrary ratio of quotas. For example, if all the quota values add up to 100,\r\neach quota value will be a percentage, but if 2 pools are specified and pool0\r\nis given a quota of 1 and pool1 is given a quota of 9, pool0 will get 10% of\r\nthe work and pool1 will get 90%. Quotas can be changed on the fly by the API,\r\nand do not act retrospectively. Setting a quota to zero will effectively\r\ndisable that pool unless all other pools are disabled or dead. In that\r\nscenario, load-balance falls back to regular failover priority-based strategy.\r\nWhile a pool is dead, it loses its quota and no attempt is made to catch up\r\nwhen it comes back to life.\r\n\r\nTo specify quotas on the command line, pools should be specified with a\r\nsemicolon separated --quota(or -U) entry instead of --url. Pools specified with\r\n--url are given a nominal quota value of 1 and entries can be mixed.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n--url poola:porta -u usernamea -p passa --quota \"2;poolb:portb\" -u usernameb -p passb\r\nWill give poola 1/3 of the work and poolb 2/3 of the work.\r\n\r\nWriting configuration files with quotas is likewise supported. To use the above\r\nquotas in a configuration file they would be specified thus:\r\n\r\n\"pools\" : [\r\n        {\r\n                \"url\" : \"poola:porta\",\r\n                \"user\" : \"usernamea\",\r\n                \"pass\" : \"passa\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n                \"quota\" : \"2;poolb:portb\",\r\n                \"user\" : \"usernameb\",\r\n                \"pass\" : \"passb\"\r\n        }\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nSOLO MINING\r\n\r\nSolo mining can be done efficiently as a single pool entry or a backup to\r\nany other pooled mining and it is recommended everyone have solo mining set up\r\nas their final backup in case all their other pools are DDoSed/down for the\r\nsecurity of the network. To enable solo mining, one must be running a local\r\nbitcoind/bitcoin-qt or have one they have rpc access to. To do this, edit your\r\nbitcoind configuration file (bitcoin.conf) with the following extra lines,\r\nusing your choice of username and password:\r\n\r\nrpcuser=username\r\nrpcpassword=password\r\n\r\nRestart bitcoind, then start cgminer, pointing to the bitcoind and choose a\r\nbtc address with the following options, altering to suit their setup:\r\n\r\ncgminer -o http://localhost:8332 -u username -p password --btc-address 15qSxP1SQcUX3o4nhkfdbgyoWEFMomJ4rZ\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nLOGGING\r\n\r\ncgminer will log to stderr if it detects stderr is being redirected to a file.\r\nTo enable logging simply add 2>logfile.txt to your command line and logfile.txt\r\nwill contain the logged output at the log level you specify (normal, verbose,\r\ndebug etc.)\r\n\r\nIn other words if you would normally use:\r\n./cgminer -o xxx -u yyy -p zzz\r\nif you use\r\n./cgminer -o xxx -u yyy -p zzz 2>logfile.txt\r\nit will log to a file called logfile.txt and otherwise work the same.\r\n\r\nThere is also the -m option on linux which will spawn a command of your choice\r\nand pipe the output directly to that command.\r\n\r\nThe WorkTime details 'debug' option adds details on the end of each line\r\ndisplayed for Accepted or Rejected work done. An example would be:\r\n\r\n <-00000059.ed4834a3 M:X D:1.0 G:17:02:38:0.405 C:1.855 (2.995) W:3.440 (0.000) S:0.461 R:17:02:47\r\n\r\nThe first 2 hex codes are the previous block hash, the rest are reported in\r\nseconds unless stated otherwise:\r\nThe previous hash is followed by the getwork mode used M:X where X is one of\r\nP:Pool, T:Test Pool, L:LP or B:Benchmark,\r\nthen D:d.ddd is the difficulty required to get a share from the work,\r\nthen G:hh:mm:ss:n.nnn, which is when the getwork or LP was sent to the pool and\r\nthe n.nnn is how long it took to reply,\r\nfollowed by 'O' on it's own if it is an original getwork, or 'C:n.nnn' if it was\r\na clone with n.nnn stating how long after the work was recieved that it was cloned,\r\n(m.mmm) is how long from when the original work was received until work started,\r\nW:n.nnn is how long the work took to process until it was ready to submit,\r\n(m.mmm) is how long from ready to submit to actually doing the submit, this is\r\nusually 0.000 unless there was a problem with submitting the work,\r\nS:n.nnn is how long it took to submit the completed work and await the reply,\r\nR:hh:mm:ss is the actual time the work submit reply was received\r\n\r\nIf you start cgminer with the --sharelog option, you can get detailed\r\ninformation for each share found. The argument to the option may be \"-\" for\r\nstandard output (not advisable with the ncurses UI), any valid positive number\r\nfor that file descriptor, or a filename.\r\n\r\nTo log share data to a file named \"share.log\", you can use either:\r\n./cgminer --sharelog 50 -o xxx -u yyy -p zzz 50>share.log\r\n./cgminer --sharelog share.log -o xxx -u yyy -p zzz\r\n\r\nFor every share found, data will be logged in a CSV (Comma Separated Value)\r\nformat:\r\n    timestamp,disposition,target,pool,dev,thr,sharehash,sharedata\r\nFor example (this is wrapped, but it's all on one line for real):\r\n    1335313090,reject,\r\n    ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff00000000,\r\n    http://localhost:8337,ASC0,0,\r\n    6f983c918f3299b58febf95ec4d0c7094ed634bc13754553ec34fc3800000000,\r\n    00000001a0980aff4ce4a96d53f4b89a2d5f0e765c978640fe24372a000001c5\r\n    000000004a4366808f81d44f26df3d69d7dc4b3473385930462d9ab707b50498\r\n    f681634a4f1f63d01a0cd43fb338000000000080000000000000000000000000\r\n    0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000080020000\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nBENCHMARK\r\n\r\nThe --benchmark option hashes a single fixed work item over and over and does\r\nnot submit shares to any pools.\r\n\r\nThe --benchfile <arg> option hashes the work given in the file <arg> supplied.\r\nThe format of the work file is:\r\nversion,merkleroot,prevhash,diffbits,noncetime\r\nAny empty line or any line starting with '#' or '/' is ignored.\r\nWhen it reaches the end of the file it continues back at the top.\r\n\r\nThe format of the data items matches the byte ordering and format of the\r\nthe bitcoind getblock RPC output.\r\n\r\nAn example file containing bitcoin block #1 would be:\r\n\r\n# Block 1\r\n1,0e3e2357e806b6cdb1f70b54c3a3a17b6714ee1f0e68bebb44a74b1efd512098,00000000001\r\n9d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f,1d00ffff,1231469665\r\n\r\nHowever, the work data should be one line without the linebreak in the middle\r\n\r\nIf you use --benchfile <arg>, then --benchfile-display will output a log line,\r\nfor each nonce found, showing the nonce value in decimal and hex and the work\r\nused to find it in hex.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nRPC API\r\n\r\nFor RPC API details see the API-README file\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFAQ\r\n\r\nQ: I have multiple USB stick devices but I can't get them all to work at once?\r\nA: Very few USB hubs deliver the promised power required to run as many devices\r\nas they fit if all of them draw power from USB.\r\n\r\nQ: I've plugged my devices into my USB hub but nothing shows up?\r\nA: RPis and Windows have incomplete or non-standard USB3 support so they may\r\nnever work. It may be possible to get a USB3 hub to work by plugging it into\r\na USB2 hub. When choosing a hub, USB2 hubs are preferable whenever possible\r\ndue to better support all round.\r\n\r\nQ: Can I mine on servers from different networks (eg xxxcoin and bitcoin) at\r\nthe same time?\r\nA: No, cgminer keeps a database of the block it's working on to ensure it does\r\nnot work on stale blocks, and having different blocks from two networks would\r\nmake it invalidate the work from each other.\r\n\r\nQ: Can I configure cgminer to mine with different login credentials or pools\r\nfor each separate device?\r\nA: No.\r\n\r\nQ: Can I put multiple pools in the config file?\r\nA: Yes, check the example.conf file. Alternatively, set up everything either on\r\nthe command line or via the menu after startup and choose settings->write\r\nconfig file and the file will be loaded one each startup.\r\n\r\nQ: The build fails with gcc is unable to build a binary.\r\nA: Remove the \"-march=native\" component of your CFLAGS as your version of gcc\r\ndoes not support it. Also -O2 is capital o 2, not zero 2.\r\n\r\nQ: Can you implement feature X?\r\nA: I can, but time is limited, and people who donate are more likely to get\r\ntheir feature requests implemented.\r\n\r\nQ: Work keeps going to my backup pool even though my primary pool hasn't\r\nfailed?\r\nA: Cgminer checks for conditions where the primary pool is lagging and will\r\npass some work to the backup servers under those conditions. The reason for\r\ndoing this is to try its absolute best to keep the devices working on something\r\nuseful and not risk idle periods. You can disable this behaviour with the\r\noption --failover-only.\r\n\r\nQ: Is this a virus?\r\nA: Cgminer is being packaged with other trojan scripts and some antivirus\r\nsoftware is falsely accusing cgminer.exe as being the actual virus, rather\r\nthan whatever it is being packaged with. If you installed cgminer yourself,\r\nthen you do not have a virus on your computer. Complain to your antivirus\r\nsoftware company. They seem to be flagging even source code now from cgminer\r\nas viruses, even though text source files can't do anything by themself.\r\n\r\nQ: Can you modify the display to include more of one thing in the output and\r\nless of another, or can you change the quiet mode or can you add yet another\r\noutput mode?\r\nA: Everyone will always have their own view of what's important to monitor.\r\nThe defaults are very sane and I have very little interest in changing this\r\nany further. There is far more detail in the API output than can be reasonably\r\ndisplayed on the small console window, and using an external interface such\r\nas miner.php is much more useful for setups with many devices.\r\n\r\nQ: What are the best parameters to pass for X pool/hardware/device.\r\nA: Virtually always, the DEFAULT parameters give the best results. Most user\r\ndefined settings lead to worse performance.\r\n\r\nQ: What happened to CPU and GPU mining?\r\nA: Their efficiency makes them irrelevant in the bitcoin mining world today\r\nand the author has no interest in supporting alternative coins that are better\r\nmined by these devices.\r\n\r\nQ: GUI version?\r\nA: No. The RPC interface makes it possible for someone else to write one\r\nthough.\r\n\r\nQ: I'm having an issue. What debugging information should I provide?\r\nA: Start cgminer with your regular commands and add -D -T --verbose and provide\r\nthe full startup output and a summary of your hardware and operating system.\r\n\r\nQ: Why don't you provide win64 builds?\r\nA: Win32 builds work everywhere and there is precisely zero advantage to a\r\n64 bit build on windows.\r\n\r\nQ: Is it faster to mine on windows or linux?\r\nA: It makes no difference in terms of performance. It comes down to choice of\r\noperating system for their various features and your comfort level. However\r\nlinux is the primary development platform and is virtually guaranteed to be\r\nmore stable.\r\n\r\nQ: My network gets slower and slower and then dies for a minute?\r\nA; Try the --net-delay option if you are on a getwork or GBT server.\r\n\r\nQ: How do I tune for p2pool?\r\nA: It is also recommended to use --failover-only since the work is effectively\r\nlike a different block chain, and not enabling --no-submit-stale. If mining with\r\na BFL (fpga) minirig, it is worth adding the --bfl-range option.\r\n\r\nQ: I run PHP on windows to access the API with the example miner.php. Why does\r\nit fail when php is installed properly but I only get errors about Sockets not\r\nworking in the logs?\r\nA: http://us.php.net/manual/en/sockets.installation.php\r\n\r\nQ: What is a PGA?\r\nA: At the moment, cgminer supports 3 FPGAs: BitForce, Icarus and ModMiner.\r\nThey are Field-Programmable Gate Arrays that have been programmed to do Bitcoin\r\nmining. Since the acronym needs to be only 3 characters, the \"Field-\" part has\r\nbeen skipped.\r\n\r\nQ: What is an ASIC?\r\nA: They are Application Specify Integrated Circuit devices and provide the\r\nhighest performance per unit power due to being dedicated to only one purpose.\r\n\r\nQ: What is stratum and how do I use it?\r\nA: Stratum is a protocol designed for pooled mining in such a way as to\r\nminimise the amount of network communications, yet scale to hardware of any\r\nspeed. With versions of cgminer 2.8.0+, if a pool has stratum support, cgminer\r\nwill automatically detect it and switch to the support as advertised if it can.\r\nIf you input the stratum port directly into your configuration, or use the\r\nspecial prefix \"stratum+tcp://\" instead of \"http://\", cgminer will ONLY try to\r\nuse stratum protocol mining. The advantages of stratum to the miner are no\r\ndelays in getting more work for the miner, less rejects across block changes,\r\nand far less network communications for the same amount of mining hashrate. If\r\nyou do NOT wish cgminer to automatically switch to stratum protocol even if it\r\nis detected, add the --fix-protocol option.\r\n\r\nQ: Why don't the statistics add up: Accepted, Rejected, Stale, Hardware Errors,\r\nDiff1 Work, etc. when mining greater than 1 difficulty shares?\r\nA: As an example, if you look at 'Difficulty Accepted' in the RPC API, the number\r\nof difficulty shares accepted does not usually exactly equal the amount of work\r\ndone to find them. If you are mining at 8 difficulty, then you would expect on\r\naverage to find one 8 difficulty share, per 8 single difficulty shares found.\r\nHowever, the number is actually random and converges over time, it is an average,\r\nnot an exact value, thus you may find more or less than the expected average.\r\n\r\nQ: My keyboard input momentarily pauses or repeats keys every so often on\r\nwindows while mining?\r\nA: The USB implementation on windows can be very flaky on some hardware and\r\nevery time cgminer looks for new hardware to hotplug it it can cause these\r\nsorts of problems. You can disable hotplug with:\r\n--hotplug 0\r\n\r\nQ: What should my Work Utility (WU) be?\r\nA: Work utility is the product of hashrate * luck and only stabilises over a\r\nvery long period of time. Assuming all your work is valid work, bitcoin mining\r\nshould produce a work utility of approximately 1 per 71.6MH. This means at\r\n5GH you should have a WU of 5000 / 71.6 or ~ 69. You cannot make your machine\r\ndo \"better WU\" than this - it is luck related. However you can make it much\r\nworse if your machine produces a lot of hardware errors producing invalid work.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis code is provided entirely free of charge by the programmer in his spare\r\ntime so donations would be greatly appreciated.
